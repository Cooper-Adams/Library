A simple webpage library. Has five books built in with JavaScript as of now, perhaps to be removed later when I am capable of linking the data to a server. 

Allows the user to add a book to the library, and makes them specify a title, author, how many pages the book is, and whether or not you have read it. Verifies input on the title, author, and pages.

When looking at the library, the user has the option to remove books, or update the "Read" status.

When inputting a new book, the user can reset the form by clicking the reset button, or they can go back to the library with the back button.
